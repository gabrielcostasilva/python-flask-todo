# PYTHON FLASK TODO APP
This is a traditional Todo Python 3 app with [Flask framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com). This project is based on [Patrick Loeber's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vfum74ggHE) analysing three Python frameworks for Web apps.

## Overview
<img src="./docs/main.png" />

The application uses the traditional MVC structure. Therefore, it consists of model, view and controller. Apart from the view, represented by the [base.html file](./templates/base.html), the code is entirelly implemented in a a single file - [application.py](./application.py).

### The Todo model

### Routes (controller)

### View (webpage)

### Additional code

## Dependencies
As expected, Flask is the main dependency for creating a Web app. The project also relies on [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) for object-relational mapping. Finally, [Jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) provides a template engine for rendering dynamic content on webpages.

In addition, the webpage uses [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com) for content styling.
